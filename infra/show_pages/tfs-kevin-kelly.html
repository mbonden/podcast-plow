  <h1>Kevin Kelly — Excellent Advice</h1>
  <h2>Transcript</h2>
  <p>Tim Ferriss: Kevin Kelly is back with a fresh batch of proverbs from his Excellent Advice series. We dive into how he crafts maxims and the frameworks behind them.</p>
  <p>Kevin Kelly: Every saying is a miniature algorithm. “Don’t be the best, be the only” came from noticing that standout creators build category-of-one niches. The maxim is a forcing function to seek uniqueness instead of comparison.</p>
  <p>Tim: You keep a daily log of observations. Kevin: I call it my “interesting notebook.” Whenever I catch myself saying “that’s curious,” I scribble it down. Months later patterns emerge. Advice is simply pattern recognition turned into instructions.</p>
  <p>Kevin: Another maxim—“Prompt debt is the new credit-card debt.” We talk about AI prompting. People stack endless experiments without reflecting on what worked. I review my best prompts weekly and write a short retro on why they succeeded.</p>
  <p>Tim: How do you avoid cynicism? Kevin: Maintain a 2:1 ratio of creation to consumption. When I feel overwhelmed by news, I make something: a photo, a poem, a letter to my children. The act of making restores agency.</p>
  <p>Kevin: For younger listeners, embrace protopianism. The future isn’t utopian or dystopian; it’s protopian—slightly better year by year. Track small improvements in your craft. Celebrate tiny increments.</p>
  <p>Kevin: I keep a jar of “micro-victories” on my desk. Whenever something delightful happens, I jot it down and toss it in. On rough days, I read a handful. It’s a simple loop for gratitude and perspective.</p>
  <p>Tim: Any closing thought? Kevin: Stay curious, document your experiments, and share your weird. The world rewards people who are generous with their learnings.</p>
