  <h1>Understanding Dopamine</h1>
  <h2>Transcript</h2>
  <p>Andrew Huberman: Dopamine is a universal currency for motivation. Today we map the peaks and troughs and discuss how to leverage them without burning out reward circuitry.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Baseline dopamine levels determine your ability to experience pleasure. Every time you get a peak—say from social media or sugar—you experience a subsequent trough. The nervous system seeks homeostasis by reducing receptor sensitivity.</p>
  <p>Andrew: To manage this, schedule dopaminergic events with space in between. Use cold exposure, exercise, or novelty to create purposeful peaks. Avoid stacking multiple high-dopamine stimuli in rapid succession.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Nutritionally, tyrosine-rich foods like eggs and beef provide the raw materials for dopamine synthesis. Ensure adequate sleep; REM sleep recalibrates dopamine receptors.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Tools include 10-minute meditation to build interoceptive awareness, journaling to note triggers, and deliberate cold exposure to release dopamine in a sustainable manner.</p>
  <p>Andrew: If you use stimulants, cycle them. Reserve caffeine for task-specific windows. Amphetamines or modafinil should be doctor-supervised. The key is not to chase highs but to maintain a stable baseline.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Gratitude practices also modulate dopamine by reinforcing social bonds. Take two minutes daily to recall a genuine act of kindness received or given.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Journaling peak experiences helps as well. When you write down why an event felt meaningful, you re-experience the neurochemical signature in a gentle way.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Remember: dopamine is about pursuit, not reward. Set process-oriented goals. Celebrate effort over outcomes to keep the system healthy.</p>
