  <h1>Dom D’Agostino — Metabolic Strategies</h1>
  <h2>Transcript</h2>
  <p>Tim Ferriss: Welcome back to another episode. Today I’m joined by Dom D’Agostino to explore metabolic flexibility, ketosis, and their impact on performance and resilience. We begin with Dom’s backstory in diving medicine and the Navy SEAL research program.</p>
  <p>Dom D’Agostino: Thanks, Tim. Early on I was tasked with figuring out how to keep divers safe under high-pressure oxygen environments. That pushed me toward ketone esters. They blunt central nervous system oxygen toxicity by stabilizing neurons, and it turns out they also help with endurance and brain energy.</p>
  <p>Tim: When people hear “ketosis,” they often think of weight loss diets. But you emphasize it as a tool. Can you lay out the pragmatic levers? Dom: Absolutely. Nutritional ketosis can be induced by time-restricted feeding, ketogenic diets, or exogenous ketones. I recommend people track glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate to understand their baseline.</p>
  <p>Dom: For therapeutic use we pair ketones with electrolytes, magnesium, and creatine. The creatine piece is huge for cognition. It fuels ATP recycling in the brain, especially under stress. In our lab we’ve seen improvements in cognitive recovery after sleep deprivation when creatine is elevated.</p>
  <p>Tim: A lot of listeners want to know the cycling protocol. Dom: I like to stack 16:8 fasting with a targeted ketogenic meal before deep work. On dive days we used 24-hour fasts plus ketone ester drinks titrated to 3 millimolar BHB. That level gives protective effects without GI issues.</p>
  <p>Dom: We also discuss hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The key is dosing. Short bouts at two atmospheres for 45 minutes, combined with ketosis, reduce oxidative stress markers. You don’t want chronic exposure; hormesis is the name of the game. We monitor inflammation with CRP and IL-6.</p>
  <p>Tim: What about exercise? Dom: Resistance training maintains GLUT4 expression even when carbohydrates are low. I pair heavy lifts with beta-alanine to support buffering. We also leverage Zone 2 cardio to build mitochondrial density. People underestimate the metabolic flexibility they can gain from simply hitting 150 minutes of Zone 2 weekly.</p>
  <p>Dom: Supplement-wise, I suggest sodium and potassium to avoid the low-carb flu. We titrate electrolytes based on sweat rate. Creatine monohydrate at 5 grams a day is my non-negotiable. For cognition we sometimes use a ketone ester shot before a cognitive battery and measure reaction times.</p>
  <p>Tim: Safety first. Dom: Yes, people with insulin-dependent diabetes or pancreatitis should work with a clinician. Otherwise, start slowly. We use CGMs to watch for hypoglycemia. Ketone strips help confirm you’re in the therapeutic window.</p>
  <p>Tim: What excites you for the future? Dom: Combining nutritional ketosis with psychedelics for traumatic brain injury shows promise. Ketones seem to buffer neural inflammation while psychedelics reopen critical periods for plasticity. We’re designing trials with low-dose psilocybin plus ketone esters.</p>
  <p>Tim: Fantastic. This was packed with actionable tactics—ketone monitoring, creatine, fasting protocols, and hyperbaric dosing guidelines. Thanks for joining, Dom. Dom: Thanks, Tim. It’s been a pleasure.</p>
