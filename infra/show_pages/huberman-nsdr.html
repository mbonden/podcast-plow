  <h1>Science of Deep Rest</h1>
  <h2>Transcript</h2>
  <p>Andrew Huberman: Welcome back to the Huberman Lab Podcast. Today we unpack non-sleep deep rest, often called NSDR. It’s a category of practices including yoga nidra, physiological sighs, and cyclic hyperventilation followed by breath holds.</p>
  <p>Andrew: NSDR is distinct from sleep. It intentionally keeps the brain in a shallow theta state. Stanford’s lab has shown that a 20-minute NSDR session can restore dopamine levels in the basal ganglia after intense focus bouts.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Protocol number one: physical relaxation. Lie down, place your feet wider than hip width, palms facing up. Start a body scan from toes to crown, releasing tension. The script should include cues for heavy limbs and warm sensations.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Protocol two engages respiration. Use a physiological sigh—two quick inhales through the nose, one long exhale through the mouth. Repeat 10 times. This drives carbon dioxide down and activates the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
  <p>Andrew: We then layer a cyclic breath: inhale for five counts, hold for 15, exhale for 10. Do three rounds. This pattern increases vagal tone. Recordings show heart rate variability improvements after just a week of daily practice.</p>
  <p>Andrew: During NSDR, it’s normal for thoughts to surface. Label them, let them pass. We use a visual anchor, such as imagining sunlight moving across the body. The goal is to keep the brain engaged but not asleep.</p>
  <p>Andrew: NSDR can be inserted between work blocks. I recommend 1 to 3 sessions per day, especially after high-intensity cognitive tasks. It dramatically reduces the time required to re-enter deep focus.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Tools: noise-cancelling headphones, an eye mask, and a scripted audio track. We have free scripts on hubermanlab.com/nsdr. Avoid caffeine for 90 minutes after waking before your first session to let cortisol peak naturally.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Combining NSDR with short naps works as well. Nap for 15 minutes, wake, then perform a 10-minute NSDR session. The nap reduces adenosine, the NSDR resets your alertness circuits.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Parents often ask if NSDR works with kids. Yes—shorter sessions with storytelling scripts calm nervous systems before bed. Keep the language playful and slow.</p>
  <p>Andrew: That concludes the deep rest toolbox. Implement it daily to enhance learning, recover from stress, and improve your overall energy budget.</p>
