  <h1>Protocols for Cold Exposure</h1>
  <h2>Transcript</h2>
  <p>Andrew Huberman: Deliberate cold exposure is a potent tool. We outline safe protocols, dosing, and physiological effects.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Start with temperature. Aim for cold water that feels “uncomfortably cold” but safe. For most people that’s 45 to 55°F. Duration matters: 11 minutes total per week, spread across two to four sessions, yields dopamine and norepinephrine increases.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Before entering, use a mindset script. Tell yourself “This is for building resilience.” Step in up to the neck. Breathe calmly through the nose, long exhales. Shivering is okay; it indicates metabolic activation.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Safety considerations: do not use cold plunges when intoxicated or after heavy meals. People with cardiovascular disease should consult a physician. Always have supervision for your first sessions.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Cold exposure after strength training can blunt hypertrophy. If you are chasing muscle growth, save cold plunges for rest days or at least six hours post-workout.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Layering tools: combine cold with heat for contrast therapy. Two minutes cold, ten minutes sauna, repeat three rounds. This improves circulation and may enhance immune function.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Track progress. Note how quickly your breathing calms and how alert you feel afterward. Many people report elevated mood for hours due to catecholamine release.</p>
  <p>Andrew: If you travel, use hotel ice buckets or cold showers. Consistency matters more than exact temperature. Even cool water can trigger adaptation when combined with breath control.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Remember, the goal is to build resilience gradually. Increase duration slowly. Cold exposure is a stress tool; dose determines whether it is beneficial.</p>
