  <h1>Tools for Focus</h1>
  <h2>Transcript</h2>
  <p>Andrew Huberman: This episode outlines a focus stack. We start with light—view morning sunlight within 30 minutes of waking for at least 5 minutes. This anchors cortisol rhythms and sets a timer for evening melatonin.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Next is respiration. Before deep work, perform three physiological sighs and 10 box breaths. This shifts autonomic tone toward parasympathetic dominance, lowering heart rate and prepping the prefrontal cortex.</p>
  <p>Andrew: We then consider pharmacology. Low-dose caffeine, 100 milligrams, combined with 200 milligrams of L-theanine smooths the rise in alertness. Avoid caffeine after 2 p.m. to protect sleep.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Cold exposure is optional but powerful. One to three minutes of cold shower or immersion increases norepinephrine two- to threefold, sustaining focus for hours. Pair it with deliberate visualization of the work goal.</p>
  <p>Andrew: During work, set a timer for 90 minutes. That matches ultradian cycles. Remove smartphones, use website blockers, and keep a distraction list to capture intrusive thoughts without switching tasks.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Supplements? Alpha-GPC at 300 milligrams can raise acetylcholine, aiding focus. Creatine at 5 grams improves energy metabolism. Always consult a physician.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Recovery is key. After intense focus, do a short NSDR session or take a 5-minute walk outside. Movement resets visual focus and reduces eye strain.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Over weeks, track your focus sessions in a journal. Rate quality and note which tools you used. The data guides personalization.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Once a week, do a “dopamine fast”—a block of time with no phone, no screens, and only analog work. This resets your ability to concentrate on demand.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Combine light, breath, pharmacology, cold, and movement to build a reliable focus protocol.</p>
