  <h1>Training for Longevity</h1>
  <h2>Transcript</h2>
  <p>Andrew Huberman: In today’s episode we build a weekly training template for lifespan and healthspan. The plan includes strength, hypertrophy, VO2 max intervals, and dedicated mobility.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Monday and Thursday are strength days. Four compound lifts—deadlift, overhead press, weighted pull-ups, and split squats. Reps stay in the 3 to 5 range. The goal is neural drive and bone density preservation.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Tuesday focuses on Zone 2 cardio. Aim for 45 minutes at a conversational pace. Heart rate should sit between 60 and 70 percent of max. This increases mitochondrial biogenesis, measured by PGC-1α expression.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Wednesday is VO2 max: six rounds of 90-second all-out efforts with three-minute recoveries. We measure improvements via time to exhaustion tests. VO2 max correlates strongly with longevity markers.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Friday is dedicated to hypertrophy. Moderate loads, 8 to 12 reps, with movements targeting connective tissue—Nordic curls, calf raises, and reverse sled drags. Tendons need specific loading to stay supple.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Saturday is for mobility and skill. We use CARs—controlled articular rotations—for hips and shoulders, plus balance drills. Mobility keeps the nervous system mapping joints accurately.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Throughout the week we layer in recovery: 7 to 9 hours of sleep, 60 grams of protein at first meal, 3 to 5 grams of creatine daily, and electrolytes during long Zone 2 sessions.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Long-term adherence matters more than perfection. Track readiness with HRV or simple reaction time tests. Adjust volume when you see fatigue trending upward for three consecutive days.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Layer in quarterly testing—DEXA scans for body composition, blood labs for lipids and inflammation, and grip strength assessments. Metrics keep the plan honest.</p>
  <p>Andrew: Longevity is built on consistency. Combine this program with social connection and mental training for a complete protocol.</p>
