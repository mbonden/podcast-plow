  <h1>Dr. Rhonda Patrick — Longevity Levers</h1>
  <h2>Transcript</h2>
  <p>Tim Ferriss: Dr. Rhonda Patrick is here to decode micronutrients and stress hormesis. We start with her lab’s recent data on magnesium supplementation.</p>
  <p>Rhonda Patrick: Magnesium is involved in more than 300 enzymatic reactions. In our randomized trial, 400 mg of magnesium threonate improved slow-wave sleep by 17 percent, measured via polysomnography.</p>
  <p>Tim: You’ve been vocal about sauna frequency. Rhonda: Correct. Finnish data shows four sessions per week at 174°F reduce cardiovascular mortality by 50 percent. The heat shock proteins triggered by sauna also upregulate FOXO3, a longevity gene.</p>
  <p>Rhonda: We pair sauna with cold exposure to increase norepinephrine spikes. Deliberate cold water at 50°F for two minutes, repeated three rounds, boosts dopamine by 2.5x lasting hours. The juxtaposition trains the autonomic nervous system.</p>
  <p>Tim: How about nutrition? Rhonda: I prioritize cruciferous vegetables for sulforaphane, wild salmon for omega-3s, and a methylated B-complex for homocysteine control. We test blood markers quarterly.</p>
  <p>Rhonda: For women’s health we’re studying choline and prenatal development. Ninety percent of pregnant women fail to hit the 450 mg RDA. Choline impacts fetal brain development and epigenetic programming.</p>
  <p>Tim: Supplements? Rhonda: Vitamin D3 at 4000 IU with K2 for synergy, creatine at 3 grams, and taurine for mitochondrial support. We avoid megadoses without lab work.</p>
  <p>Rhonda: The big takeaway is hormetic stress layered with micronutrient sufficiency. Alternate between sauna, cold, resistance training, and mindful recovery. Track biomarkers and adjust. Longevity is the sum of consistent practices.</p>
  <p>Rhonda: And remember, community matters. People who maintain friendships and a sense of purpose see lower all-cause mortality. Pair the biochemical levers with connection and play.</p>
  <p>Tim: Thanks, Rhonda, for the practical longevity roadmap.</p>
