  <h1>Whitney Wolfe Herd — Scaling with Purpose</h1>
  <h2>Transcript</h2>
  <p>Tim Ferriss: Whitney Wolfe Herd joins me to unpack what it means to scale communities with intention. We revisit the origin story of Bumble and how constraints, not blitz-scaling, made the product resilient.</p>
  <p>Whitney Wolfe Herd: When we launched, we had three engineers and a handful of ambassadors. The constraint forced us to focus on safety features first. We built a reporting flow before virality loops. That decision preserved trust when we expanded globally.</p>
  <p>Tim: You talk a lot about micro-feedback. Whitney: Yes, we set up campus councils, essentially customer discovery pods. Every week we asked them to record Loom videos about what felt awkward in the onboarding funnel. The data was qualitative but rich.</p>
  <p>Whitney: Another lever was rethinking metrics. Instead of chasing MAU, we measured respectful interactions. We built a kindness score derived from support tickets and conversation length. That became the north star for the product team.</p>
  <p>Tim: Hiring is notoriously hard. Whitney: We hired slow, using narrative memos. Candidates wrote a one-page future press release about the feature they wanted to ship. It showed us their taste and allowed introverts to shine in interviews.</p>
  <p>Whitney: When the company scaled, I leaned on mentors who had done it before—Sara Blakely, Tory Burch. They taught me to design my calendar around energy. I batch investor meetings on one day, leaving creative time open.</p>
  <p>Tim: What about the personal toll? Whitney: Boundaries. I log off by 7 p.m., and the leadership team does the same. The rule is: urgent decisions happen synchronously, everything else lives in asynchronous memos.</p>
  <p>Whitney: For entrepreneurs listening, remember that product-market fit is not a finish line. It’s a daily practice. Keep a dashboard that tracks experimentation cadence and customer feedback cycles. Velocity beats perfect strategy.</p>
  <p>Whitney: We also invested early in mental health support. Therapists joined leadership off-sites to facilitate hard conversations. Psychological safety isn’t just a poster on the wall; it’s reinforced through rituals.</p>
  <p>Tim: Any final asks? Whitney: Build for the version of the world you want. Diversity on the founding team matters because product defaults mirror the creators. Start small, iterate with live users, and let your values shape the roadmap.</p>
  <p>Tim: Thank you, Whitney. That’s a wrap packed with actionable wisdom on community-led growth, metrics with heart, and building teams that reflect the product promise.</p>
